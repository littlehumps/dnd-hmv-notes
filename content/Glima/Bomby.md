Bomby is a short dumpy man who the party encountered during the [[Midsummer Festival]] in [[Glima]]. Bomby and his wife, [[Sophia]], took part in various games against the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]. 

During the dance challenge, Bomby could not move. At the same time his wife let out a stinky fart whilst pole-dancing around him. Bomby told Sophia that she stank. He has also gambled away all their money. 

[[Scouse]] informed the party that Sophia murdered Bomby with a frying pan and they ate his corpse.
