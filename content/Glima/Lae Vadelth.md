At the end of the [[Midsummer Festival]], Lae Vadelth gave the following speech to the crowd:

"Esteemed citizens of our beloved realm. On this auspicious night of the midsummer festival, I stand before you with a heart full of gratitude and joy. As the full moon rises high above us, let us take a moment to reflect on the blessings bestowed upon our land. May the light of the gods bless our fields, and guide our people through the hardships that may come. As we look upon MOON NAME, I must share with you a sombre tale. A tale of love, loss, and the descent into madness. 

In an age before the [[Great Calamity]], many great dragons protected this land. One of such rulers was the platinum dragon, [[Evray]]. But Evray did not rule alone. He had a mate, and they formed a bond so powerful that together, not even the greatest foe would dare to disrupt their peaceful land. They protected the people, the animals, and all that lived in their domain. That was until [[Sin]] appeared. 

Many of our draconic protectors took to the front lines, ultimately to their own demise. Evray and his mate were lucky and somehow survived the great battle, but at a hefty cost. Evray succumbed to the corruption of Sin, a corruption so powerful it drove him to the brink of insanity. 

His mate could not bear to watch him suffer so greatly, and fled to the sky, never to be seen again. Some say she was selfish, others say she went in search of a cure. But all poor Evray knew was that his most beloved had gone. Vanished. Disappeared into the sky during the Midsummer full moon. He mourned her loss, howling into the winds, and over the years began to believe that she had become the moon herself. 

Now, each midsummer festival, Evray can be sighted circling the skies, trying with all his might to reach his beloved. So tonight, as you look into the sky and give thanks to the gods, do not forget to also give thanks to Evray; the tragic hero who gave everything to protect his people." 

After the party arrived back in [[Glima]], it appeared Lae Vadelth had a friendship and agreement with [[Fudrana]].
