**insert something here about how the party met Tink**

Syntak took [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] to see [[Tink]] in the hope that she would be able to fix Astra or provide some answers for her. Tink, with [[Arra]] present, proceeded to look into the metal skulls of [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] and Syntak and found they were almost identical in their make and design. However Syntak seemed to be missing some sort of cartridge and the connections to this had been severed. Tink attempted to restore this connection which caused Syntak to power down and the following message was heard by [[Tink]], [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] and [[Arra]]: 

*"Warning, warning, critical malfunction detected; host link compromised. Initiating emergency protocol #03, prepare for separation. Error detected- neuron link disconnected, memory core not found. Unit 103, provide status report. 103, return to station for repair and reboot."*
