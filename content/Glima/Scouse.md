Scouse is a mimic who the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] met in a cave during the start of their travels. Scouse has taken the form of a dinosaur-like cat and a beautiful woman. In the latter form Scouse had a sexual encounter with [[Wren]]. 

Scouse stayed with the party on their journey back to [[Glima]] under the premise that it would be allowed to eat any fresh corpses they create in their path. Scouse decided to stay in Glima and not join the party. 

Scouse decided to set up their own brothel, [[The Green Shaft]], in partnership with [[Sophia]]. Scouse confirmed that they ate the corpse of [[Bomby]] after witnessing Sophia murder him with a frying pan.
