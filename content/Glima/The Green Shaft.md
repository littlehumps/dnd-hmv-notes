The Green Shaft is a brothel run by [[Scouse]] and [[Sophia]], located in the Undercity of [[Glima]].

When the party visited the brothel, [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Wren|Wren]] was visited by [[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]]. Only she could see The Judge due to something [[Scouse]] had spiked her drink with.
