Woof is a steel defender created by [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Syntak|Syntak]] (and the MVP of the [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Heavy Metal Vagabonds|Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]). 

When Woof was heavily damaged during a battle in a cave north of [[../Glima/Glima|Glima]], [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Syntak|Syntak]] rebuilt him to make him even stronger than before.
