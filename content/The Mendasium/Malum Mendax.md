Malum Mendax is a 'lawyer' in  [[The Mendasium]]

The [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Heavy Metal Vagabonds|Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] visited [[Malum Mendax]] hoping that he could help Arra escape his deal with [[../Other NPCs/Lolth]]. Arra made a new deal where, if he dies, his soul would belong to [[Malum Mendax]]. Following this he turned Arra into a beetle. 

Malum Mendax has a shitty receptionist called [[Coco]] that no one likes. 

When Arra was squished by [[../Shamuti Island/Fudrana|Fudrana]] he bargained with [[Malum Mendax]] to keep his life a little longer, claiming that:
- He was being resurrected so he wouldn't be staying dead
- He has a job to do which he is yet to fulfil
- If Malum Mendax wanted him dead now, he could have done it at anytime.
