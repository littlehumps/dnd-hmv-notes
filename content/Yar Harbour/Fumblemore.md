Fumble more is a crazy old wizard living in the Lighthouse in [[Yar Harbour]]. He has an addiction to [[Gilk]] which is a drink directly milked from [[Grib]].

When the party meet Fumblemore he's high off his tits and requires them to find more Gilk for him to transport them to [[Shamuti Island]]. The party decide that it's too much of a risk given his condition and instead try to speak with [[Alocious]] instead.

When the rest of the party are travelling on the ship, [[Aenar]] and [[Wren]] decide to visit Fumblemore and he transports them to the island.
