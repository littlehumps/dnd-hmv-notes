Bastian is the governor of [[Yar Harbour]]. 

He holds 3 rules for it's dwellers and visitors:
1. Don't take from those who have less than you do. 
2. Be loyal, fair, and on the square. 
3. People aren't cargo.

[[Syntak]] was the first to meet him after witnessing him police injustice in his town. Bastian is a man who respects honesty and doesn't like those who abuse power. When Bastian asked who he knows from [[Glima]] he was very careful with who he named. One person he named was [[Jet]], who just happened to be Bastian's niece.

Bastian gave advice to the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] on two possible options to get to [[Shamuti Island]]. The first was to speak to [[Alocious]], the second to speak to [[Fumblemore]]
