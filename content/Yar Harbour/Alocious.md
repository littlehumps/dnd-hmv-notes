Alocious is a bard from [[Yar Harbour]]. His crew got caught in a storm when sailing near [[../Shamuti Island/Shamuti Island|Shamuti Island]] and Alocious was the only one to return. His appearance had changed from a handsome Triton to a shark/human hybrid. 

When the [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Heavy Metal Vagabonds|Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] meet him he has a reputation for aggression and heavy drinking. They are warned by many not to approach him or ask about what happened during that fatal day at sea.

With the help of the tavern's barmaid (and Alocious' wife), [[Robin]], the party convinced Alocious to perform on stage with them to recite a beautiful version of Wonderwall (My Haul). After softening up to the party, Alocious agreed to help transport them to [[../Shamuti Island/Shamuti Island|Shamuti Island]]. 

Alocious decided to stay on the island with [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Kailan Cobble|Kailan Cobble]] and search for his missing crew.

Alocious Crew:
- Vasilica (sister)
