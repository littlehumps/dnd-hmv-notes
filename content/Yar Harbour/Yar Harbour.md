Formally known as Port Nemu, Yar Harbour is a town ran by the people and for the people. It is a pirate town with many shops.

The main governor of the town is [[Bastian]], who holds 3 rules for it's dwellers and visitors:
1. Don't take from those who have less than you do. 
2. Be loyal, fair, and on the square. 
3. People aren't cargo.

When the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] reach Yar Harbour they witness a member of aristocracy being pelted with rotten food by the locals. As part of their quest to travel to [[Shamuti Island]], the party required safe passage. [[Bastian]] pointed them to two options; a drunk and aggressive shark-man called [[Alocious]], and a drug-addicted crazy old wizard in lighthouse called [[Fumblemore]]
