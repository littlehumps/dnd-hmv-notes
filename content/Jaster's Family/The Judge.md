The Judge is part of [[Jaster]]'s family. 

In a cave not far from [[Glima]], The Judge approached [[Silvie]]. It is not yet known what they discussed.

In [[The Green Shaft]] brothel, whilst under the influence of a drink that [[Scouse]] spiked, [[Wren]] was approached by The Judge and asked to join forces with the family as they may be able to help her. The Judge visited Wren the same evening.
