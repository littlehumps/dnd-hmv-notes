The Judge is part of [[Jaster]]'s family. 

In a cave not far from [[Glima]], The Judge approached [[Silvie]]. It is not yet known what they discussed.

In [[The Green Shaft]] brothel, whilst under the influence of a drink that [[Scouse]] spiked, [[Wren]] was approached by The Judge and asked to join forces with the family as they may be able to help her. The Judge visited Wren the same evening. 

In the forest of Pelorus, Swampy caught a raccoon trying to steal the party's rations for it's 'babies'. The raccoon lured the party to a nest of baby rocs, which subsequently caused the mother to attack the party. After defeating the adult roc, Swampy climbed back up the tree to check on the babies. The raccoon turned out to be [[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]], tricking the party, but Swampy did not recognise them. 

[[Wren]] made a deal with The Judge agreeing that she would take an unknown liquid and pour it into the well at [[../Snowcoat/Snowcoat|Snowcoat]], in return for reclaiming some of her memories. The Judge showed her visions of her final moments before she died. For Wren a fog cleared, just as it had done for [[../Champions of Tara/Ramiel|Ramiel]] when [[Ellie Smith]] entered his mind, showing that she was not shot in the eye with an arrow, but pierced by [[Aenar]]'s sword.
