### Lore

Ellie is part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]. The party met her in a cave north of [[Glima]]. She is a doctor who has been working in the under city.

During the [[../Glima/Midsummer Festival|Midsummer Festival]], Ellie received a skeleton elk mount called [[Sir Samuel]]. 

When [[Ellie Smith]] ran out of her medicine in [[Yar Harbour]], she attacked [[Kailan Cobble]]. She explained to him that she is a vampire and he allowed her to feed off him until she found more medicine. 

Ellie tried to help Kailan contact his old friends. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and only a screaming white face similar to those they saw in [[The Mendasium]] appeared. 

On the ship to [[Shamuti Island]], whilst put under mental trials by [[The Guardian]], Kailan was briefly turned to stone but was saved from this by Ellie. Throughout their time together their friendship grew close as he was the only one to learn of her secret until the re-appearance of [[Aenar]]. Aenar also discovered that Ellie is a vampire and has been hostile ever since.

Ellie's real name is Lord Claymore, part of the [[Claymore Family]], which was revealed by both [[Hevlaska]] and later by [[Lae Vadelth]]. 

[[../Glima/Lae Vadelth|Lae Vadelth]] advised Ellie that she no longer needs to conduct her work in [[../Glima/Glima|Glima]], her new job is to protect her friends through the dangers they will now face. This convinced Ellie to tell the rest of the party about her vampirism before they headed out to [[../Snowcoat/Snowcoat|Snowcoat]].
