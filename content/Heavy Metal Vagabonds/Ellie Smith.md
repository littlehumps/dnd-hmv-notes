Ellie is part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]


Ellie's real name is Lord Claymore, part of the [[Claymore Family]], which was revealed by both [[Hevlaska]] and [[Lae Vadelth]].

When [[Ellie Smith]] was running out of her medicine, she attacked [[Kailan Cobble]]. She explained to him that she is a vampire and he allowed her to feed off him until she found more medicine. 

Ellie tried to help Kailan contact his old friends. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and only a screaming white face similar to those they saw in [[The Mendasium]] appeared. 

On the ship to [[Shamuti Island]], whilst put under mental trials by [[The Guardian]], Kailan was briefly turned to stone but was saved from this by Ellie.
