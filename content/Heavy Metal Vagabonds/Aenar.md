### Joining the Party
Aenar is a [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara]] and fought in the [[Great Calamity]]. She is currently in a new timeline and part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]. 

The party met her in a cave north of [[Glima]], captured by Ogres. She was very confused about the year and where she was. During her time in the cave Aenar took a love potion by accident and had a very shot romantic relationship with [[Cherlodyte]], a troglodyte they were fighting. Cherlodyte was killed within minutes by another troglodyte and Aenar, devasted by her grief, left the party. 

### Journey to Shamuti
Aenar reappeared in [[Yar Harbour]], bumping into [[Wren]]. For a very brief moment she had a northern accent from her travels. She advised that [[Swamp Potato]] was in danger and that they must travel to [[Shamuti Island]] to save her. Wren and Aenar travelled to the island via magic after visiting [[Fumblemore]] in his lighthouse.

Aenar told the party about [[Jaster]] and his family and the dangers that may be ahead of them. For a while [[Aenar]] called people sluts because she didn't know what it meant. 

### Journey to the Fire Plains
In the swamp of Perolus the party met [[Key]], a mechanical bird. Key appeared to know Aenar from before the [[../Lore/Great Calamity|Great Calamity]], yet Aenar had no recollection of [[Key]]. Key then guided Aenar to a statue of [[Ramiel]], the 9th [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara|Champion of Tara]], beneath a waterfall. 

Ellie, and eventually [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Aenar|Aenar]], bring Ramiel back to his body by entering his mind, but it begins to crumble and his last words to Aenar share that what they were doing was wrong... they were wrong. At the same time [[Wren]] spoke to [[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]] who showed her visions of her final moments before she died. For Wren a fog also cleared, showing that she was not shot in the eye with an arrow, but pierced by [[Aenar]]'s sword. 

[[Wren]] tried to lie to the party about her conversations with [[[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]], but was soon caught in her deception, her anger targeted at [[Aenar]]. In [[Howl]]'s house, [[Aenar]] finds a book and starts to learn what noises different animals make.

In the [[../Fire Plains/Fire Plains|Fire Plains]], Aenar uses one of [[../Other NPCs/Howl|Howl]]'s collars to disguise herself as a slaver, with [[Wren]] as her slave. Her appearance is intimidating to many due to the rank of citizen she is seen as. Aenar witnesses an orb being sold during an auction at [[Hammer Time]] that appears to contain innocence. She questions the auction master but in doing, alerts suspicion and ravens begin to chase the party. 

To evade the chase, Aenar created two methods of distraction. She first casted darkness on a sausage, which she gave to [[Swamp Potato]] in her hellhound form. Swampy ran around the town with the [[Sausage of Darkness]], causing chaos but also shielding the party from view. Aenar also used the remainder of her love potion on a guard called [[../Fire Plains/Ank|Ank]], who was immediately enthralled by her beauty. She convinced Ank to hand all of his clothes to [[Ellie Smith]] to further conceal her appearance, along with all of his savings and his bag of holding - but not before begrudgingly giving him a kiss. 

When the ravens finally caught up with the party, one was revealed to be [[../Champions of Tara/Evangalic|Evangalic]] the 14th [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara|Champion of Tara]].
