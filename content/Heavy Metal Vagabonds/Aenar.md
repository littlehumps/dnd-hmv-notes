### Lore
Aenar is a [[Champion of Tara]] and fought in the [[Great Calamity]]. She is currently in a new timeline and part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]. 

The party met her in a cave north of [[Glima]], captured by Ogres. She was very confused about the year and where she was. During her time in the cave Aenar took a love potion by accident and had a very shot romantic relationship with [[Cherlodyte]], a troglodyte they were fighting. Cherlodyte was killed within minutes by another troglodyte and Aenar, devasted by her grief, left the party. 

Aenar reappeared in [[Yar Harbour]], bumping into [[Wren]]. For a very brief moment she had a northern accent from her travels. She advised that [[Swamp Potato]] was in danger and that they must travel to [[Shamuti Island]] to save her. Wren and Aenar travelled to the island via magic after visiting [[Fumblemore]] in his lighthouse.

Aenar told the party about [[Jaster]] and his family and the dangers that may be ahead of them. For a while [[Aenar]] called people sluts because she didn't know what it meant.
