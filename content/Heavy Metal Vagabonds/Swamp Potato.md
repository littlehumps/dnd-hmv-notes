### Joining the Party
Swampy is one of the [[Druids]] from [[Shamuti Island]] who ran away as a small child. She hid her powers until becoming part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] and feeling safe to do so. 

She first met [[Aenar]] in a cell in a cave north of [[Glima]] after looking for her parents and falling through a hole. They were soon rescued by the rest of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] who they met for the first time.

[[Swamp Potato]] was the only person to witness [[Silvie]] ascend from the bottom of the cave looking like a red devilish-type creature before she left the party.

On their journey back to [[Glima]], [[Syntak]] revealed he knew Swampy was a druid but would keep her secret for her. 

When they visited [[Malum Mendax]], Swampy took a disliking to his receptionist [[Coco]] for being judgemental and stuck up. 

During the [[Midsummer Festival]], Swampy bumped into [[Berry Lyn]], a childhood friend from [[Shamuti Island]]. She convinced Swampy that [[Druids]] are safe here and she should tell her friends her identity. Before telling the rest of the party she decided to show bug-form [[Arra]], due to his love for the druids and wanting to believe they were real. She conjured flowers around him using druidcraft. 

### Journey to Shamuti
Swampy travelled to Shamuti Island with the party to see if Fudrana could help [[Arra]] turn back from his beetle form. Fudrana agreed but asked that Swampy took [[The Oath]] and complete her trials in the volcano.

Within the volcano the party met [[Hevlaska]] who told the party about how the island protects [[../Champions of Tara/Innocence]] and how a chosen one must be found. Swampy passed her trials and became a [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara]], wielding a new pair of boots that contain [[../Champions of Tara/Innocence]]. 

The innocence then showed Swampy the truth about her parents, [[Barny Door]] and [[Celery Sue]]. When she was young, a group of [[Shapeshifters]] infiltrated the island, removed Swampy's parents and replaced them for the remainder of her life. She does not know what happened to her parents or where the shapeshifters now are.

### Journey to the Fire Plains
In the forest of Pelorus, Swampy caught a raccoon trying to steal the party's rations for it's 'babies'. The raccoon lured the party to a nest of baby rocs, which subsequently caused the mother to attack the party. After defeating the adult roc, Swampy climbed back up the tree to check on the babies. The raccoon turned out to be [[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]], tricking the party, but Swampy did not recognise them. She left the stolen rations with three of the eggs and proceeded to look after the other two eggs herself, which she has named 'Benedict' and 'Sunny', in the hope that they'd come across someone who could care for them. She placed the eggs in Wren's back of holding.

[[Arra]] revealed to Swampy that when [[../Shamuti Island/Fudrana|Fudrana]] brought him back to life and the rest of the party carried out The Oath, he learned the way of the [[../Lore/Druids|Druids]] and now has druidic powers. They agree to train and learn their new skills together. 

Swampy finds [[Howl]] tied up in a bathroom after the party first meet [[../Other NPCs/Mim]]. After helping the party escape, Howl begins to flirt with Swampy, who doesn't know how to react as she is beginning to develop feelings for [[Arra]]. She helps [[Arra]] with his first wild shape after practising turning into scorpion with him. 

In the [[Fire Plains]], Swampy transforms into a hellhound with a collar reading 'Good Girl' which they found in Howl's house. Her keen sense of smell lead her to the local sausage vendor, as well as a friendly Orc called [[../Fire Plains/Gorc]], who was selling bits and bobs and played fetch with her. Eventually she lead the party to [[Hammer Time]], an auction house, where [[Liberty]] was being sold as a slave. 

To evade the chase of ravens, [[Aenar]] casted darkness on a sausage, which she gave to Swampy. Swampy ran around the town with the [[Sausage of Darkness]], causing chaos but also shielding the party from view. She chased after [[Syntak]]'s scent, but he didn't know it was Swampy with the sausage and proceeded to run away with [[Liberty]].
