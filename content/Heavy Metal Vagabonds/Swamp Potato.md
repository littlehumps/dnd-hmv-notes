**Lore**
Swampy is one of the [[Druids]] from [[Shamuti Island]] who ran away as a small child. She hid her powers until becoming part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] and feeling safe to do so. 

Swampy travelled to Shamuti Island with the party to see if Fudrana could help [Arra] turn back from his beetle form. Fudrana agreed but asked that Swampy took [[The Oath]] and complete her trials in the volcano.

Within the volcano the party met Hevlaska who told the party about how the island protects [[Innocence]] and how a chosen one must be found. Swampy passed her trials and became a [[Champion of Tara]], wielding a new pair of boots that contain [[Innocence]]. 

The innocence then showed Swampy the truth about her parents, [[Barny Door]] and [[Celery Sue]]. When she was young, a group of [[Shapeshifters]] infiltrated the island, removed Swampy's parents and replaced them for the remainder of her life. She does not know what happened to her parents or where the shapeshifters now are.
