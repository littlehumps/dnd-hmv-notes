Appearance: 
Familiar: Arra has a large spider-eating wasp familiar called [[Vum]]
Lore: 

Arra joined the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] in [[Glima]] and joined [[Dolly]]'s faction. Arra originally had a pact with [[Lolth]] the spider demon. 

Arra visited [[Malum Mendax]] in the [[The Mendasium]] hope that he could help him escape his deal with [[Lolth]]. He made a new deal where, if he dies, his soul would belong to [[Malum Mendax]]. Following this Arra was turned into a beetle which, for the time being, he was quite happy with. 

The [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] transported Arra in his bug form to [[Shamuti Island]] in the hope that [[Fudrana]] would turn him back in to his original form. [[Fudrana]] squished Arra so that he returned to [[Malum Mendax]]. Here he bargained with the devil to keep his life a little longer. Through the resurrection spell Arra was brought back as a sea elf.
