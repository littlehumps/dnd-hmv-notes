### Lore
Arra joined the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] in [[Glima]] and joined [[Dolly]]'s faction. Originally Arra, [[Wren]] and [[Syntak]] were drawn to each other due to their similar circumstances and socially awkward nature. Arra originally had a pact with [[../Other NPCs/Lolth]] the spider god. Arra would fiddle with a cats cradle and scratch to ease the feeling whenever he needed to use her power. 

Arra comes from a travelling unit known as Edisco. They believed, if they believed, then that belief would bring back the [[../Lore/Druids|Druids]]. Arra is a proper Druid fanboy. 

On their travels back to [[Glima]] from the cave, Arra's body was taken over by [[../Other NPCs/Lolth]] as revenge for trying to push her away and he began to attack his friends. Arra was determined to do anything to stop this from happening again. 

Arra visited [[Malum Mendax]] in the [[The Mendasium]] hoping that he could help him escape his deal with [[../Other NPCs/Lolth]]. He made a new deal where, if he dies, his soul would belong to [[Malum Mendax]]. Following this Arra was turned into a beetle which, for the time being, he was quite happy with. The party were less so. 

The [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] transported Arra in his bug form to [[Shamuti Island]] in the hope that [[Fudrana]] would turn him back in to his original form. [[Fudrana]] squished Arra so that he returned to [[Malum Mendax]]. Here he bargained with him to keep his life a little longer, claiming that:
- He was being resurrected so he wouldn't be staying dead
- He has a job to do which he is yet to fulfil
- If Malum Mendax wanted him dead now, he could have done it at anytime. 

Through the resurrection spell Arra was brought back as a much taller and broader sea elf. Unfortunately, he was also naked and everyone saw his wang. As the party assisted [[Swamp Potato]] with [[../Shamuti Island/The Oath|The Oath]], Arra trained and adjusted to his new body with a group of sea elves on the island. 

With his new found abilities Arra was able to conjure a new companion called [[../Companions and Mounts/Vum]], a spider-eating wasp.
