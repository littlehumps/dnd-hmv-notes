**Lore**
Arra joined the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] in [[Glima]] and joined [[Dolly]]'s faction. Arra originally had a pact with [[Lolth]] the spider demon. 

On their travels back to [[Glima]] from the cave, Arra's body was taken over by [[Lolth]] as revenge for trying to push them away and he began to attack his friends. Arra was determined to do anything to stop this from happening again. 

Arra visited [[Malum Mendax]] in the [[The Mendasium]] hope that he could help him escape his deal with [[Lolth]]. He made a new deal where, if he dies, his soul would belong to [[Malum Mendax]]. Following this Arra was turned into a beetle which, for the time being, he was quite happy with. 

The [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] transported Arra in his bug form to [[Shamuti Island]] in the hope that [[Fudrana]] would turn him back in to his original form. [[Fudrana]] squished Arra so that he returned to [[Malum Mendax]]. Here he bargained with the devil to keep his life a little longer. Through the resurrection spell Arra was brought back as a much taller and broader sea elf. 

With his new found abilities Arra was able to conjure a new companion called [[Vum]], a spider-eating wasp.
