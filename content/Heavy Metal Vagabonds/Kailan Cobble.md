Kailan is a former member of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]]. The party met him after visiting [[Malum Mendax]]. 

When [[Ellie Smith]] was running out of her medicine, she attacked Kailan. She explained to him that she is a vampire and he allowed her to feed off him until she found more medicine. 

Ellie tried to help Kailan contact his old friends. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and only a screaming white face similar to those they saw in [[The Mendasium]] appeared. 

On the ship to [[Shamuti Island]], whilst put under mental trials by [[The Guardian]], Kailan was briefly turned to stone but was saved from this by Ellie.

Throughout their time together their friendship grew close as he was the only one to learn of her secret until the re-appearance of [[Aenar]]. Aenar discovered that Kailan was in-fact, undead himself. 

During the battle with [[Hevlaska]], Kailan turned into a giant monster rabbit. He decided to stay on the island with [[Alocious]] and thanked the party for their help.
