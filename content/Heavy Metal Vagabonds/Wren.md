![[Wren-20240802155155541.webp|386]]

### Joining the Party
Wren is part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] and part of [[Dolly]]'s faction in [[Glima]]. When joining the party [[Syntak]] helped fix Wren's arm and [[Arra]] gave them both directions when they were lost. Wren also kissed an elf princess girl before joining the party.

In a cave north of [[Glima]], the party stumbled upon a dinosaur-looking cat called [[Scouse]]. Scouse turned out to be a mimic and made passionate(?) love to Wren. 

During the [[Midsummer Festival]], Wren was handed a doll and started to uncover happy memories. She also purchased a bow which felt more natural in her hands than her guns. Wren also gave her arm to [[../Glima/Tink]] for repairs. 

### Journey to Shamuti
On the journey north, the party discovered Wren is writing a book about a group of travellers, only slightly dissimilar to their own. 

In [[Yar Harbour]] Wren made friends with a russian-sounding duck called [[Reuban]].

Wren has a list of rules which we don't currently know who she was given these by. Wren first shared these rules with [[Swamp Potato]].

### Joining the Fire Plains
In [[The Green Shaft]] brothel, whilst under the influence of a drink that [[Scouse]] spiked, [[Wren]] was approached by [[The Judge]] and asked to join forces with the family as they may be able to help her. The Judge visited Wren the same evening. 

In the swamp of Perolus, the party met [[../Other NPCs/Key]]. When [[Swamp Potato]] tried to discuss [[../Other NPCs/Fortadayne|Fortadayne]] more with Wren, [[../Other NPCs/Key]] hopped over, and revealed that she not only knows knows him, but that he also lives at her home along with someone called [[JoJo]]. When the party follow [[../Other NPCs/Key]] to look at a statue of [[../Champions of Tara/Ramiel]], Wren instead went deeper into the forest and called out to [[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]]. 

Wren made a deal with The Judge agreeing that she would take an unknown liquid and pour it into the well at [[../Snowcoat/Snowcoat|Snowcoat]], in return for reclaiming some of her memories. The Judge showed her visions of her final moments before she died. For Wren a fog cleared, just as it had done for [[../Champions of Tara/Ramiel|Ramiel]] when [[Ellie Smith]] entered his mind, showing that she was not shot in the eye with an arrow, but pierced by [[Aenar]]'s sword. 

Wren tried to lie to the party about her conversations with [[[../Jaster's Family/The Judge|The Judge]], but was soon caught in her deception, her anger targeted at [[Aenar]]. In [[../Other NPCs/Howl]]'s house, [[Ellie Smith]] learns more about Wren's deal with The Judge, and the impact this could have on the people of [[../Snowcoat/Snowcoat|Snowcoat]]. The two fight and Wren is left feeling sad and alone. 

In the [[../Fire Plains/Fire Plains]], Wren is disguised as a slave.
