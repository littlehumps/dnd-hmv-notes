### Lore
Wren is part of the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] and part of [[Dolly]]'s faction in [[Glima]]. When joining the party [[Syntak]] helped fix Wren's arm and [[Arra]] gave them both directions when they were lost. Wren also kissed an elf princess girl before joining the party.

In a cave north of [[Glima]], the party stumbled upon a dinosaur-looking cat called [[Scouse]]. Scouse turned out to be a mimic and made passionate(?) love to Wren. 

During the [[Midsummer Festival]], Wren was handed a doll and started to uncover happy memories. She also purchased a bow which felt more natural in her hands than her guns. Wren also gave her arm to [[Tink]] for repairs. 

On the journey north, the party discovered Wren is writing a book about a group of travellers, only slightly dissimilar to their own. 

In [[Yar Harbour]] Wren made friends with a russian-sounding duck called [[Reuban]].

Wren has a list of rules which we don't currently know who she was given these by. Wren first shared these rules with [[Swamp Potato]].

In [[The Green Shaft]] brothel, whilst under the influence of a drink that [[Scouse]] spiked, [[Wren]] was approached by The Judge and asked to join forces with the family as they may be able to help her. The Judge visited Wren the same evening.
