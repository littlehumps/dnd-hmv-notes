**Lore**
Syntak joined the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] and [[Dolly]]'s faction in [[Glima]]. He has a companion dog who he built called [[Woof]]. 

During the [[Midsummer Festival]] Syntak won a mount; a large beetle whom he named [[Chitter]].

On the road to [[Yar Harbour]], [[Lupe]] heard the sound of his mother calling to him. Syntak helped Lupe reconnect with his family and his companion said goodbye.

Follow this the party were attacked by a group of bandits. During the fight Syntak's eyes glowed red and he entered a frenzy. After this he could not remember what happened. 

Whilst on the ship to [[Shamuti Island]], Syntak had a dream where he felt like he couldn't breathe (which is unusual as he can't breathe anyway). In it he could hear voices in the distance.

Syntak was gifted [[Innocence]] by [[Hevlaska]] whilst Swampy was taking [[The Oath]]. After completing her puzzle, he is also now a [[Champion of Tara]].
