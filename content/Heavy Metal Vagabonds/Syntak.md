### Joining the Party
Syntak joined the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] and [[Dolly]]'s faction in [[Glima]]. He has a companion dog who he built called [[../Companions and Mounts/Woof]]. 

On the way to the cave north of [[../Glima/Glima|Glima]] they found a pack of injured direwolves and entered into a fight with a large group of orcs. During the fight an ancient army of tree saplings helped fight the orcs. Syntak found a small puppy called [[../Companions and Mounts/Lupe]]. Syntak tried to give Lupe back to his mother but because she was so injured, [[../Other NPCs/Wiseash|Wiseash]] advised them to look after him. 

In the cave Syntak almost lost control and set fire to a den of baby troglodytes. 

During the [[Midsummer Festival]] Syntak won a mount; a large beetle whom he named [[../Companions and Mounts/Chitter]].

### Journey to Shamuti
On the road to [[Yar Harbour]], [[../Companions and Mounts/Lupe]] heard the sound of his mother calling to him. Syntak helped Lupe reconnect with his family and his companion said goodbye. Around this time Syntak also crafted [[../Companions and Mounts/Buzz]], a small mechanical dragonfly. 

Following this the party were attacked by a group of bandits. During the fight Syntak's eyes glowed red and he entered a frenzy. After this he could not remember what happened. 

Whilst on the ship to [[Shamuti Island]], Syntak had a dream where he felt like he couldn't breathe (which is unusual as he can't breathe anyway). In it he could hear voices in the distance but could not move.

Syntak was gifted [[../Champions of Tara/Innocence]] by [[Hevlaska]] whilst Swampy was taking [[The Oath]]. After completing her puzzle, he will be a [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara]].

On the island Syntak met fellow warforged, [[../Other NPCs/Astra]]. Originally he wanted to stay on the island to learn more about his kind, but [[Aenar]] convinced him to stay with the party and [[../Other NPCs/Astra]] decided to join them on their journey back to [[../Glima/Glima|Glima]]. 

### Journey to the Fire Plains
Syntak took [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] to see [[../Glima/Tink]] in the hope that she would be able to fix Astra or provide some answers for her. Tink, with [[Arra]] present, proceeded to look into the metal skulls of [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] and Syntak and found they were almost identical in their make and design. However Syntak seemed to be missing some sort of cartridge and the connections to this had been severed. Tink attempted to restore this connection which caused Syntak to power down and the following message was heard by [[../Glima/Tink]], [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] and [[Arra]]: 

*"Warning, warning, critical malfunction detected; host link compromised. Initiating emergency protocol #03, prepare for separation. Error detected- neuron link disconnected, memory core not found. Unit 103, provide status report. 103, return to station for repair and reboot."*

At the same time Syntak was plunged into the same dreamlike state as he was on the way to Shamuti. This time he was able to feel what appeared to be his own humanoid hands bang on the glass, like he was drowning in a container of fluid, before his consciousness returned to his mechanical form once more. 

Syntak shared this with the rest of the party, along with [[../Other NPCs/Key|Key]]. Key revealed that Syntak has actually been around a long time and has just been 'asleep'. Looking at the structure of Key and how she was built, they realised that they both had the same master but Syntak almost the original protoype. Key revealed that home is nearby and they should visit - but wasn't sure of the exact location.

Syntak appears to be gaining affection for [[../Other NPCs/Astra|Astra]] and finds her very interesting.

In [[Howl]]'s house, Syntak was able to change the door mechanism and the party were transported to the [[Fire Plains]]. To move around the Fire Plane safely, he pretended to be 'Multi-tool', [[Ellie Smith]]'s mechanical servant. In the crowd of [[Hammer Time]], the local auction house, Syntak was able to disguise his appearance as one of the guards and save [[Liberty]] from being taken to her new slaver, taking her back to [[Howl]]'s house. Syntak seems to know who Liberty is.
