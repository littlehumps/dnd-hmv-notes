Ramiel is the 9th [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara|Champion of Tara]]. When the [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Heavy Metal Vagabonds|Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] met [[../Other NPCs/Key|Key]], she guided [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Aenar|Aenar]] to a statue at the bottom of a waterfall in Pelorus. The statue was of Ramiel, and it appeared from Aenar and [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Swamp Potato|Swamp Potato]]'s connection the [[Innocence]], that someone or something may still be  within it. [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Ellie Smith|Ellie Smith]] began to use her thought detection to connect with whatever life may be linked to the statue.
