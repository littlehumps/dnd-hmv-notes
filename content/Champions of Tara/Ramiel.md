Ramiel is the 9th [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara|Champion of Tara]]. When the [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Heavy Metal Vagabonds|Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] met [[../Other NPCs/Key|Key]], she guided [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Aenar|Aenar]] to a statue at the bottom of a waterfall in Pelorus. The statue was of Ramiel, and it appeared from Aenar and [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Swamp Potato|Swamp Potato]]'s connection the [[Innocence]], that someone or something may still be  within it. 

[[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Ellie Smith|Ellie Smith]] used her thought detection to connect with whatever life may be linked to the statue. She saw visions of Ramiel defeating hordes of demons with [[../Jaster's Family/Epsilon|Epsilon]] shouting for him to see what [[Tara]] is making him do. The fog in the vision cleared and Ramiel realises he is killing innocent civilians. 

Ellie and [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Aenar|Aenar]] bring Ramiel back to his body, but it begins to crumble and his last words to Aenar share that what they were doing was wrong... they were wrong.
