Ank is a guard in the [[Fire Plains]]. Aenar used the remainder of her love potion to charm him into helping the party and he was immediately enthralled by her beauty. She convinced Ank to hand all of his clothes to [[Ellie Smith]] to further conceal her appearance, along with all of his savings and his bag of holding - but not before begrudgingly giving him a kiss.
