Grib was working in [[Yar Harbour]] selling [[Gilk]] (kind of as a drug dealer). Her main buyer was [[Fumblemore]]. 

Grib stowed herself away on the boat as a green dog and ended up joining the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] on their journey to [[Shamuti Island]]. She helped [[Swamp Potato]] feel what it's like to be a bird and fly. 

Grib is friends with [[Flamehat]] and travelled back with her to their world.
