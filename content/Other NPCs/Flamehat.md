When the [[Heavy Metal Vagabonds]] met [[Grib]], Flamehat was just a small ball of fire that followed her. After [[Kailan Cobble]] accidentally groped Grib whilst trying to get back the items she stole, Flamehat appeared in her original form. Flamehat is very protective of Grib and was initially wary of the party, but warmed to them after a few drinks or two. 

On the ship to [[Shamuti Island]], Flamehat was also subjected to nightmarish visions by [[The Guardian]]. 

Flamehat is pregnant with the child of [[Portalus]], who appeared through a portal to take her and Grib back home. Flamehat handed a coin to [[Swamp Potato]] so that she can summon Portalus in a time of need.
