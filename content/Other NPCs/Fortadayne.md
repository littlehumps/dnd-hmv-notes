Wren has a list of rules which we don't currently know who she was given these by. The 10th rule on her list is to find Fortadayne. 

When [[Swamp Potato]] tried to discuss [[../Other NPCs/Fortadayne|Fortadayne]] more with Wren, Key hopped over, and revealed that she not only knows knows him, but that he also lives at her home along with someone called [[JoJo]]. She proceeded to sing the tune of [[The Vault of Fortadayne]] for the party.


### The Vault of Fortadayne
The Vault of Fortadayne:
Locked in his cellar a tinkerer sits, 
With his dreams of gold and fame. 
Nery a worry for the life that he birthed, 
Filled with joy and love and pain. 

As he tinkered, he lost his compassion, 
For the ones he abandoned upstairs. 
Till a scream swirled around as his child hit the ground just outside, 
The Vault of Fortadayne. 

Now you would think that this would be the pinnacle of misfortune that poor Fortadayne would see. 
But you know, those who let grief and guilt consume them, only open the doors for further torment to enter. 
But what was Fortadayne doing you ask? 
Why didn’t he see the danger coming? 
How did things end this way? 
Fear not! Vedina will tell you. 
Spewing with anguish and bottomless guilt, He searched for hope in vain.
Against his wife’s wishes he captured her soul, In a vessel of magic and chains. 
In the mountains he searched for an answer, 
And just when he thought hope was lost. 
Did he fall 60 feet to fast moving creek where he found,
The Vault of Fortadayne.
