Portalus is the God of Sailing, Alcohol and Victory in the Patheon of Lux 

As the youngest, he was prone to making more brash decisions and taking rushed, passionate actions in comparison to the rest of his Godkin, such as being tempted to step onto the Material Plane in a Living Form. 

He was eventually convinced by [[Flamehat]], who charmed him by following his beliefs and calling upon his blessing- a coin for a drink, as well as being attracted to her feminine wiles. He soon conceived a child with Flamehat, before being called back to the Ascended Plane. He remained in contact and in constant reach of his child's mother, through his blessing, now changed to a single coin that could call for his presence.

This coin was handed by Flamehat to [[Swamp Potato]] in case she ever needed help.
