In the swamp of Perolus the party met Key, a mechanical bird. Key had a soul crystal inside of her that appeared to be dying out from the amount of time she'd been left in the swamp. With healing from [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Ellie Smith|Ellie Smith]] she sprung back to life. Key introduced herself to the party as "the key to every door". Key also appeared to know [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Aenar|Aenar]] from before the [[../Lore/Great Calamity|Great Calamity]], yet Aenar had no recollection of Key.

When [[Swamp Potato]] tried to discuss [[../Other NPCs/Fortadayne|Fortadayne]] more with Wren, Key hopped over, and revealed that she not only knows knows him, but that he also lives at her home along with someone called [[JoJo]]. She proceeded to sing the tune of [[The Vault of Fortadayne]] for the party.

[[Aenar]] followed Key to look at a statue of [[../Champions of Tara/Ramiel]], the 9th [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara|Champion of Tara]], beneath a waterfall.
