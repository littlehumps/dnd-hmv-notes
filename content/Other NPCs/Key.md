In the swamp of Perolus the party met Key, a mechanical bird. Key had a soul crystal inside of her that appeared to be dying out from the amount of time she'd been left in the swamp. With healing from [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Ellie Smith|Ellie Smith]] she sprung back to life. Key introduced herself to the party as "the key to every door". Key also appeared to know [[../Heavy Metal Vagabonds/Aenar|Aenar]] from before the [[../Lore/Great Calamity|Great Calamity]], yet Aenar had no recollection of Key.

When [[Swamp Potato]] tried to discuss [[../Other NPCs/Fortadayne|Fortadayne]] more with Wren, Key hopped over, and revealed that she not only knows knows him, but that he also lives at her home along with someone called [[JoJo]]. She proceeded to sing the tune of [[The Vault of Fortadayne]] for the party.

[[Aenar]] followed Key to look at a statue of [[../Champions of Tara/Ramiel]], the 9th [[../Champions of Tara/Champion of Tara|Champion of Tara]], beneath a waterfall. Key was excited to see her friend but sadly he crumbled when the party tried to bring him back to his body.

Key revealed that [[Syntak]] has actually been around a long time and has just been 'asleep'. Looking at the structure of Key and how she was built, they realised that they both had the same master but Syntak almost the original protoype. Key revealed that home is nearby and they should visit - but wasn't sure of the exact location.
