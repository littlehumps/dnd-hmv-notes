The Oath is what young [[Druids]] must take when they turn 18  on [[Shamuti Island]]. Some may day, others may survive and one may become a chosen protector for the realm. 

Those taking The Oath must prove their worth to [[Hevlaska]], and also to the [[../Champions of Tara/Innocence]] that they may potentially wield themselves.
