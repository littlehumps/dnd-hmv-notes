Fudrana Shum is one of the [[Druids]] and the protector of [[Shamuti Island]]. 

When [[Swamp Potato]] asked for help with transforming her friend [[Arra]] out of his beetle form, Fudrana agreed to help providing that Swampy took [[The Oath]]. She had a lot of faith in Swampy and helped guide her towards her destiny. 

[[Fudrana]] squished Arra so that he returned to [[Malum Mendax]] and proceeded to resurrect him as a sea elf. 

After Swampy completed her trials and visited her family home, she informed Fudrana of the [[Shapeshifters]] on the island. Fudrana advised Swampy that her and her friends should leave the island and that she would do what she could to put things right. 

Through a tree in [[Shamuti Island]], she helped the party travel back to [[Glima]].
