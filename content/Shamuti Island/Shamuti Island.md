Shamuti Island is home to the [[Druids]]. It is currently watched over by [[Fudrana]]. 

It is a remote island, protected by [[The Guardian]] and all those who have tried to venture there have failed.  

When a young druid becomes of age on the island they are required to take [[The Oath]]. A challenge held within the volcano in order to find a protector for the island or even the realm as a whole. The volcano, and the [[../Champions of Tara/Innocence]] held within it, is guarded by [[Hevlaska]].

[[Shapeshifters]] have been known to infiltrate the island in the past and others have tried to claim the innocence for themselves - therefore it has been kept a secret from everyone except a few trusted people such as [[Lae Vadelth]].
