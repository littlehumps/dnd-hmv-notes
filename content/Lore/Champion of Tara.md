A Champion of Tara is a warrior who has successfully merged or bonded with an [[Innocence]]. When merged or bonded, the Innocence becomes one with the wielder's soul. If unsuccessful, the wielder dies. They may manifest into weapons depending on their wielder, or grant them power in another way. If the physical aspect of an Innocence is lost or destroyed, the power still remains inside the host, only at a significant weakness. 

Historically, [[Tara]] held power over the Innocence, and granted each one to thirty of her most powerful and competent priests, creating her holy avengers, thus granting them the title Champion of Tara. There were thirty known Champions of Tara in existence before the calamity, including [[Aenar]]. The most recent adventurer to receive and successfully bond with an Innocence is [[Swamp Potato]], receiving the affectionate title Swamp Potato the Fourteenth. Swamp Potato is the newest Champion of Tara after bonding with her Innocence which took the form of metal boots which allows her to manipulate the earth around her.
