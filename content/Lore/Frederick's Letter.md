Dearest Mother, 

Oh the sites to behold up North, [[Snowcoat]] certainly holds up to it's reputation, I must take you and Rhi some day. The snow fall takes time to get acustomed to, but I don't think I could ever get bored of it! Though as beautiful as [[New Eden]] it, it's not without it's dangers. I believe there to be something... wrong, in that city. I can't figure out what, but something tells me it is a place to remain vigilant. Nevertheless, it is a place for the bucket list, that's for sure! 

I met a woman who seemed quite inquisitive about the family, kept asking about my bloodine. Strange, I don't recall ever meeting her before, maybe she recognised father's pocketwatch. Even with her weird questions, she is the most beautiful creature I have ever laid eyes on. After returning home, I plan to return to New Eden and ask for her hand. I spent all but a day in her company and already I find myself aching from being far away from her. 

I found a buyer for that odd artifact, a weird fellow who wouldn't give me his name. Said he was a member of "[[The Black Order]]". Sounds suspicious, but I'm just thankful to be rid of the damn thing. I pray this small fortune helps our family, I'm just sorry the journey has taken so long. I am about 2 days away from [[Glima]] and will send this letter by bird, I hope it finds you well. I should arrive back in [[Canvas Town]] in around 2 weeks. Give Rhi my love. Tell her that her father will bring home more sweets than she can stomach. 

Frederick
